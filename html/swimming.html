        <p class="mainText">Swimming is the movement of the body through water using arms and legs.
            Most of the time equipment is not used. People swim for exercise, for fun, [1] and as a sport.
            People can swim in the sea, swimming pools, rivers and lakes. There are several styles of
            swimming, known as "strokes", including: breaststroke, freestyle, butterfly, and backstroke
            are some of them. Many schools use swimming as a physical training exercise.
            Swimming works all the muscles simultaneously. It is impact free
            . It also builds up stamina. The goal of competitive swimming is to improve speed,
            and to beat other competitors in events. Some professional swimmers, who do not hold
            a national or world ranking, are considered the best because of their technical skills.
            An athlete goes through several stages of training. At the beginning, the body is overloaded with
            work. The workload becomes less closer to the date of the competition. This final stage is often
            referred to as "shave and taper"; the swimmer tapering downs his or her workload to be able to
            perform at their optimal level. At the end of this stage, before competition, the swimmer shaves off
            all exposed hair and dead skin. Often confused within shaving, swimmers shave to rid the skin of dead s
            kin cells to expose sensitive skin to the water. The effect of shaving is a decrease in drag from hair
            and an increase in the sensation of "feeling" the water. Women who are menstruating may also use tampons
            rather than pads.
